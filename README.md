## Flow of Dapp


* You have the option to create a detailed listing for an item on the portal, providing all the necessary information and specifications.
- Any individual can initiate a buy request for the product you have listed.
- As the seller, you can accept or reject the buy request based on your discretion and business requirements.
- A comprehensive product receipt is automatically generated once you accept a buy request. This receipt encompasses all the essential details related to the transaction, including the purchase date, price, and buyer information.
- By utilizing the unique product ID associated with each item, you can easily access and retrieve extensive information about the product.
- Furthermore, the system provides a mechanism to validate the authenticity of the generated receipt. You can verify whether the receipt is original and legitimate, safeguarding against any potential fraudulent activities.
